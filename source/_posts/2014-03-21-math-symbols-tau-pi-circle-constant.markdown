What is a mathematical symbol ?

**A mathematical symbol is the projection of an abstract concept on a small 2D plane section.**

As human memory is limited and costly, we should strive to make the _unprojection_ as painless as possible.
That means good symbols. They should scale well, and be as different to one another as the concepts are.


## π is not the most elegant constant

For starters, read the [Tau manifesto](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto).

Then, frown upon that migraine-inducing sentence :

{% blockquote Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_mathematical_symbols %}
Pi (π) is equivalent to the amount of area a circle would take up in a square of equal width with an area of 4 square units, roughly 3.14/4.
{% endblockquote %}

Okay, I cherry-picked that definition because it is especially contrived.
But compare it to the following :

{% blockquote %}
Tau (τ) is the circumference of the unit circle.
{% endblockquote %}

(the unit circle has a radius of 1)

I rest my case ; pie is delicious, but π is wrong.


## π is not a good symbol (and neither is τ !)

We're talking about the **circle** constant.

Three or two perpendicular segments (even if they're a bit curvy) do not evoke a circle. Nope.


### A case for ◯

I move that when we do rewrite our mathematics (which we'll do, eventually), **we use ◯ as symbol for the circle constant**.

Which would yield :

{% blockquote %}
The circle constant (◯) is the circumference of the unit circle.
{% endblockquote %}

Of course, that ain't gonna happen soon, as the zero was chosen for this symbol.
I suspect it is because of smoke rings. A smoke ring is nothing -- Wisdom of the shisha.

Smoke rings are [vortex rings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring) of air.

_Ideas are vortex rings of words._


### Drawing the radius too

I'm not decided about it, but assuming we want to, we'd have to choose an angle, and I don't see any absolute elegance here.
It all depends on the way we project the rest of the concepts, both in their own symbols and in their interactions with each other.
If 1 is a vertical dash, it should be vertical. If 1 is horizontal (like in chinese), it should be horizontal.


## Alternatives to τ

Anything that would drive the lips into a circle might be good enough. _ooooooooooooooooohhm..._

I'm going to start using ◯ (pronounced O) to describe the circle constant (and ostracize myself a bit more).
