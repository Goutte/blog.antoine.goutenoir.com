I experimented a bit with _canvas_ and _paper.js_, and made an [online doodle app](http://antoine.goutenoir.com/contact)
working quite nicely on powerful tablets.

You can fork the whole project on github.

{" The trick was to have two separate canvases "}, one for the path being drawn, and the other for the paths already drawn.
PaperScript’s ~~tricky~~ clever scoping is inspiring — my usage of it feels like a hack.

Remember to press `C` for _Free Cake&copy;_ once you've drawn some lines !
