A blog is not a proper place to host code ; Github is.

On mootools-cloud, you will find [javascript snippets and mootools extensions](https://github.com/Nutellove/mootools-cloud),
written in the mootools-more way as much as possible. Feel free to fork it !

_Openness of knowledge is paramount for the very survival of our civilization._
It’s a long-term point of view and an arguable one ; and it’s definitely not my code that’ll influence anything.
Though, all in all, removing the hindrances to access to knowledge will spawn a smarter generation more likely to make smarter decisions.
