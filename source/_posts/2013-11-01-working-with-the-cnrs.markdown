As of December 2013, I'll be working for the [IRAP](http://www.irap.omp.eu) (Astrophysics and Planetary Science Institute),
doing code migration, data treatment and manipulation for [MUSE](http://muse.univ-lyon1.fr) (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer).

We'll be using this data to study galaxies, galactic winds, and overall for _serendipity_.
